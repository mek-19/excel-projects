Hey there! 👋

I’m excited to share some Excel projects I’ve been working on lately. These projects helped me level up my Excel skills by solving real-world problems — and I’d love for you to check them out!

Here’s a quick look at what I’ve built so far:

1️⃣ Car Inventory  
I put together a neat car inventory tracker, where you can see all the important details — make, model, price, availability, and more.  
I made sure the data stays accurate with handy Excel features like data validation and lookup functions.

2️⃣ Crystal Pools Project  
This one’s all about pool construction — I analyzed the costs and details to help with better planning and budgeting.  
Formulas and functions did the heavy lifting to make calculations fast and reports clear.

3️⃣ Decision Maker  
Sometimes picking the best option isn’t easy. So, I built a decision matrix that scores choices based on what matters most, making those tough calls easier.  
Excel’s logical formulas helped me make it smart and dynamic.

4️⃣ Gradebook  
A simple grade tracker for students — it calculates averages and highlights performance trends automatically.  
I also added some color with conditional formatting to spot the highs and lows quickly.

5️⃣ Payroll Project  
Automated payroll? Yes, please! This workbook calculates salaries, taxes, and net pay, so nothing slips through the cracks.  
It’s packed with formulas that make payroll a breeze.

6️⃣ Comparison Project — Multiple Scenarios  
This is a flexible template I made to compare different business scenarios side by side.  
It uses advanced functions to give me multiple angles for better decision-making.
